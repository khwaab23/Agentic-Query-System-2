# 🛡️ SECURITY NOTICE

## ⚠️ API Key Security

**IMPORTANT**: If you accidentally committed your `.env` file with your real API key to a public repository, you need to:

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **🔄 Rotate Your API Key**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Delete the exposed API key immediately
   - Generate a new API key
   - Update your local `.env` file with the new key

2. **🧹 Remove from Git History** (if committed)
   ```bash
   # Remove the file from git tracking
   git rm --cached .env
   
   # Add .gitignore (if not already done)
   git add .gitignore
   
   # Commit the changes
   git commit -m "Remove .env file and add to .gitignore for security"
   ```

3. **🔍 Monitor API Usage**
   - Check your OpenAI usage dashboard for any unauthorized activity
   - Set up usage alerts if available

### Prevention for Future:

- ✅ Always use `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files
- ✅ Use environment variables in production
- ✅ Never hardcode API keys in source code
- ✅ Use `.env.example` files for templates
- ✅ Review commits before pushing to ensure no secrets are included

### This Repository's Security:

- ✅ `.gitignore` now includes `.env` files
- ✅ Only `.env.example` template is committed
- ✅ Real API keys are kept local only

**Remember**: Treat API keys like passwords - keep them secret and secure!
